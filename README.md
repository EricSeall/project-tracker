# Project Tracker - A simple MERN web application for keeping track of work-in-progress musical productions

The application is live [here](https://tracker.aceauramusic.com) for anyone to use!

## Features

### Project

The "Project" is the main building-block of the application. Users can create Project cards in order to store useful information about tracks they're working on such as:
- **Project Name** - The name of the work-in-progress.
- **Streaming Link** - An optional link to a streamable version of the track for quick and easy access. Adds a button to the top left of the card when entered.
- **Priority Level** - How important the track is to finish.
- **Due Date** - An optional date that the track needs to be completed by.
- **Description** - Any additional notes about the track that you'd like to remember.

### To-Do List
- Each Project card when pressed will lead to a detailed view where a user can add to a list of items to complete for the track. This is an easy way for the user to take notes on what they would like to change or add to the track for their next production session.
